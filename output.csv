<p>In a distressing incident last night, reckless driving led to a multi-vehicle crash inside the Bangabandhu Tunnel in Chattogram, resulting in damage to at least five vehicles and injuring several people. The accident, occurring in one of the tunnel's lanes, underscores the growing concerns over traffic safety.</p>
<p>Assistant Sub-Inspector Billal Hossain of the Karnaphuli Police Station, under the Chattogram Metropolitan Police, reported that the chain-reaction collision was initiated by a private car that lost control due to excessive speed. The vehicle's erratic maneuvering led to it colliding with nearby cars, impacting a total of three private cars and two microbuses.</p>

This accident adds to a troubling pattern of similar occurrences within the Bangabandhu Tunnel, which has seen seven to eight accidents in the mere four months following its inauguration on October 28 last year.</p>
<p>The situation has been further complicated by a video that surfaced online, showcasing illegal car racing inside the tunnel immediately after its opening.

20240330;20240330;Dhaka;Wheels of hazard: Motorcycle safety crisis unfolding on Bangladesh’s roads;"<div class=""text"">
<div class=""news-article-text-block text-patter-edit ref-link"">
<p>In Bangladesh, motorcycles, with their ease of navigation and cost-effectiveness, have become a popular mode of transport. However, this preference comes with a significant drawback: motorcycles are at the epicenter of the nation’s road safety crisis. While there was a hopeful decrease in motorcycle-related accidents in the past year compared to 2022, these two-wheelers remain the most common protagonist in the tragic tales of road accidents across the country. The situation is dire, with not only deaths being a common outcome but an increasing number of individuals suffering life-altering injuries, including the loss of limbs.</p>
<p>The National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR), a vigilant civic organization, illuminates this pressing issue with alarming statistics: from 2020 to 2023, 33-40% of all annual road accidents involved motorcycles. This figure has been on a distressing upward trajectory since the start of this year. According to the NCPSRR, the daily average ranges from 8 to 10 fatalities in 10 to 12 motorcycle accidents—a grim statistic that often escapes the attention of the national media spotlight.</p>
<p>The heart of this crisis is attributed to the presence of underage, unskilled, and unlicensed drivers on the roads. The lack of stringent enforcement by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the police has been pinpointed as a contributing factor. Ashis Kumar Dey, the general secretary of NCPSRR, doesn’t mince words when he lists the reasons behind the spike in motorcycle accidents: the proliferation of motorcycles, including many that are unlicensed, and reckless driving habits are significant contributors. Dey strongly believes that both law enforcement and the regulatory body, BRTA, need to intensify their efforts.</p>
<p><a href=""https://unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/motorcycle-rider-dies-in-dinajpur-road-crash/132287"">Motorcycle rider dies in Dinajpur road crash</a></p>
<p>To combat this escalating problem, Dey proposes a comprehensive crackdown on underage and unlicensed riders and unregistered motorcycles. He advocates for the implementation of mobile courts across all districts for three consecutive months, a bold strategy aimed at curtailing the rampant violations contributing to road safety hazards.</p>
<p>The Road Safety Foundation (RSF) adds a quantitative dimension to the discourse with its annual report, revealing that in 2023, 6,524 individuals, including 974 women and 1,128 children, lost their lives in 6,911 road accidents across the country. Motorbike riders and pillion passengers comprised a staggering 38.12% of these fatalities.</p>
<p>Delving deeper into the data, RSF provides a comparative analysis of motorcycle accidents and fatalities over recent years, presenting a grim narrative of increasing incidents and loss of lives, peaking in 2022. However, a glimmer of hope emerges from the 2023 statistics, showing a 14.83% decrease in accidents and a 19.54% drop in fatalities compared to the previous year. Despite this positive trend, Saidur Rahman, executive director of RSF, remains cautious, warning that this decrease should not be prematurely celebrated as a sign of sustained improvement in road safety.</p>
<p>Rahman further elaborates on the challenges at hand, pointing out that motorcycles constitute 71% of all motor vehicles in the country, with a significant portion of these riders being teenagers and young adults. This demographic exhibits a pronounced disregard for traffic laws, exacerbated by a lack of stringent monitoring and enforcement, leading to reckless behavior and tragic outcomes. <br>The discourse takes a critical turn as Rahman highlights the frequent clashes between motorcycles and larger vehicles such as trucks, covered vans, and buses. The drivers of these larger vehicles often lack the necessary skill or are overworked, contributing to their involvement in accidents with motorcycles. The inadequacy of the public transport system and the chronic issue of traffic congestion have further popularized motorcycles as a preferred mode of transport, despite the associated risks.</br></p>
<p><a href=""https://unb.com.bd/category/Bangladesh/man-hit-by-motorcycle-in-jatrabari-dies/132572"">Man hit by motorcycle in Jatrabari dies</a></p>
<p>In a noteworthy development, Rahman acknowledges the role of increased awareness and the efforts of highway police in the recent decline in motorcycle accidents. Abu Raihan Md Saleh, Joint Commissioner (Traffic-North) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, supports this view, attributing the reduction in accidents to the rigorous enforcement of traffic laws. Saleh’s remarks underline the police’s commitment to curbing reckless riding, unregistered bikes, and license violations, although this has led to complaints from bikers about perceived overzealous policing.</p>
<p>Saleh also emphasizes the crucial role of parental responsibility in preventing underage and inexperienced individuals from taking to the roads on motorcycles. He expresses optimism that with heightened vigilance from parents and guardians, the trend of motorcycle accidents can be further curbed.</p>
<p>This multifaceted crisis of motorcycle safety in Bangladesh calls for a concerted effort from all stakeholders: law enforcement, regulatory bodies, civic organizations, and the community at large. The statistics and stories paint a clear picture of the challenge ahead, yet they also offer a blueprint for action. By addressing the root causes of motorcycle accidents and implementing targeted safety measures, Bangladesh can hope to navigate its way out of this perilous situation, making its roads safer for everyone.</p>

</div>";"Motorcycles have many features that make them attractive to riders, and they can also be dangerous if not ridden properly. Motorcycle accidents are one of the leading causes of death on the road. According to a  in 2016, motorcycles are responsible for 28% of global fatalities on the roads. Motorbike accidents can be catastrophic, often resulting in serious injury or death. While there is no guarantee that you will never have an accident if you ride a motorcycle, following some simple safety tips can help reduce your risk of crashing. Let’s check out some prevention tips to help keep you safe on the road.10 Safety Tips to Minimise the Risk of Motorbike accidentAlways Wear a HelmetA helmet is your first and most important line of defence in the event of a crash. And can help to reduce the risk of brain injury. In addition, helmets can also help to protect your face from the elements and from flying debris. When choosing a helmet, be sure to select one that meets DOT safety standards and that fits snugly on your head. Wearing a helmet is one of the best ways to reduce your risk of being injured in a motorcycle accident.Read Always Wear Protective GearIn addition to a helmet, wearing other protective gear such as leather or synthetic pants, a jacket, gloves, and boots can help to minimise the risk of injuries in the event of a crash. These simple precautions can help to keep yourself safe on the road.Obey The Speed LimitThe speed limit is there for a reason. Obeying the posted limit can help prevent motorcycle accidents. Higher speeds increase the chances of losing control of the bike and make it more difficult to stop or avoid obstacles. In addition, speeding makes it more likely that other motorists will not see the motorcycle in time to avoid an accident. And if an accident does occur, the faster the bike is going, the more serious the injuries are likely to be. So, whether you are out for an easy ride or trying to get somewhere in a hurry, obey the speed limit and help keep everyone safe on the road.Read Be Aware of Your SurroundingsMotorcycle accidents can happen in the blink of an eye and often result in serious injuries or even death. In order to help prevent these accidents, it is important to be aware of your surroundings at all times when riding. Pay attention to the road ahead and be on the lookout for potential hazards, such as potholes, debris, or sudden changes in the weather. If you see something that could potentially cause an accident, slow down and proceed with caution.Use Turn SignalsMany people enjoy the freedom and independence that comes with motorcycle riding; this can be dangerous as accidents are all too common. One way to help prevent motorcycle accidents is to use turn signals. Read Turn signals give other drivers a heads up about your intentions, and they can help avoid potential collisions. In addition, turn signals can also help you communicate with other riders in your group. So, whether you are going for a leisurely ride or hitting the open road, be sure to use your turn signals to help prevent motorcycle accidents.Stay VisibleOne of the best ways to prevent motorcycle accidents is to make sure that you are visible to other motorists. Wearing bright clothing and using reflective materials can help to make you more visible, especially at night or in poor weather conditions. Additionally, mounting reflective strips on your motorcycle can also help to increase your visibility. By taking these simple steps, you can help to make sure that you arrive at your destination safely.Read Avoid DistractionsAnother effective way to avoid an accident is to stay focused on the task at hand: driving. Unfortunately, this can be easier said than done. Distractions like cell phones, other vehicles, and even scenic views can take your attention away from the road ahead. That is why it is so important to be aware of your surroundings and keep your eyes on the road at all times.By remaining attentive, you can help make sure that everyone enjoys safe and accident-free roads.Practise Smart Riding HabitsAs any motorcycle enthusiast knows, there is nothing quite like the feeling of freedom on the open road. However, this sense of freedom comes with a responsibility to practise safe riding habits. It may be tempting to show off your skills, but it is much better to stumble on the side of caution. Read By following all the rules and safe riding habits, you can help to prevent motorcycle accidents and enjoy many happy miles on the open road.Perform Regular MaintenanceAccidents are inevitable. But there are some accidents that can be prevented with a bit of care and attention. Motorcycle accidents, for example, often occur due to negligence on the part of the rider. Improper maintenance of the bike can lead to brake failure, tire blowouts, and other problems that can cause an accident. That is why it is important to perform regular maintenance on your motorcycle, including checking the tire pressure, brakes, and engine oil levels. By taking a few minutes to do this simple maintenance, you can help prevent a potentially fatal accident.Read Don’t Drink and DriveLast but not least, riding a motorcycle while impaired can be extremely dangerous. Do not drink and ride under any circumstances. This is agist the law and very dangerous even though you are an excellent rider.Final WordsMotorcycle crashes are a common occurrence, and they can be shattering. If you are involved in a crash, remember these tips: stay calm, call emergency if necessary, and wait for help to arrive. Apart from these tips, they always keep you updated with the new laws, roads, and weather conditions. Thus, you can ensure a safe ride for yourself as well as for all.Read"

</div>";Fire burnt three trucks in India’s Petrapole, opposite the Benapole port, on Saturday morning.The trucks were waiting to enter Bangladesh through Benapole, officials said.No casualties were reported.Kartik Chakraborty, general secretary of the Petrapole Port Staff Association in India, said fire originated from a truck loaded with bleaching powder on Saturday early hours.Read: There was no driver in the truck and fire gutted two more trucks loaded with cotton, near it. After reporting to the fire service, they managed to put out the fire after a two-hour effort, he said.Rain causes bleaching powder to burn, so he suggested that the powder should be carried in covered trucks rather than open ones to avoid fire incidents.Mamun Kabir Tarafdar, Deputy Director of Benapole Port, said three cargo trucks, waiting to import goods to Bangladesh, burnt down in Petrapole. However, the trucks were removed immediately and the vehicles are crossing at normal pace.

<div class=""news-article-text-block text-patter-edit ref-link"">
<p><strong>Titas</strong> <strong>Gas</strong> Transmission and Distribution Company is going to take up a massive project to <strong>overhaul its age-old gas pipelines</strong> in <strong>Dhaka</strong> metropolitan city to make the flow more smooth and minimize risks of accidents.</p>
<p>Official sources said the plan for changing the ageing pipelines came to be regarded as the core needs amid a series of recent explosions and fire accidents blamed on faulty and leaking lines.</p>
<p>When a huge explosion killed at least six people and injured several others in Moghbazar in last June, fire service officials suspected leakage in Titas gas line as the cause.</p>

<p>Leakage in Titas pipeline at a mosque in Fatullah led to the explosions in six air conditioners leaving at least 27 people killed and over a dozen injured during Friday prayers in 2020, in one of country’s worst gas explosions.</p>
<p>These tragic incidents apart, the issue of the leakage in pipelines also came to the attention of the authorities when Titas Gas started installing pre-paid meters in parts of the city.</p>

<p>Titas officials said their teams found huge leakages in pipelines in both customers’ end as well as utility end when they worked for pre-paid gas meters in recent years.</p>

<p>Admitting the issue, a top official of Titas Gas said that they are now working on the ministry’s instructions to overhaul the pipelines.</p>
<p>According to official sources, initially a plan was earlier submitted to the energy and mineral resources division of the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources for approval.</p>
<p>But it was reverted to the Titas Gas authority with some observations and suggestions to accommodate those in the plan, said a senior official of energy and mineral resources division.</p>

<p> “We’ve sent back the relevant file with some observations and suggestions to follow those in their plan to make it more effective”, he told UNB preferring anonymity as he was not authorized to speak on the issue.</p>
<p>Titas Gas general manager (planning and development) Shafiqul Islam, who is dealing with the plan, informed that the organisation’s current plan is to conduct a techno-economic feasibility study first and then prepare a design based on its report to implement the proposed pipeline replacement project.</p>
<p> “Preparing a geographic information system (GIS) mapping is also part of the plan”, he added.</p>
<p>He said the Titas Gas authority is now in a process to appoint a consultant to conduct the study.</p>

<p>Official sources said as per the plan the Titas Gas will replace the aged-old pipeline in 60 administrative zones, out of total 139 zones across its command area.</p>
<p>The proposed area is mainly located in the Dhaka metropolitan city although Titas has a vast network elsewhere including in Narayanganj, Savar, Manikganj, Munshiganj, Mymensing and Norsingdi.  </p>
<p>Officials said the pipeline replacement project will be implemented by the Titas’ own funds.</p>
<p>However, the financial involvement in the project is yet to be determined as this will depend on the report of the techno-economic feasibility study and on the basis of the next design.</p>

<p>Shafiqul said pipelines too dilapidated for the service and unfit to serve the growing gas supply demand will be changed.</p>
<p> “But, those found to be in good condition will be kept”, he said adding that this work will be a kind of BMRE (balancing, modernization, rehabilitation and expansion).</p>
<p>He also informed that one of the main objectives of the techno-economic study is tracing out the leakage in the pipeline network. Titas Gas’s huge network has pipelines of different diameters that include from 3/4 to 16 diameters.   </p>

<p>Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company, having a customer base of 2.874 million, has been responsible for gas supply to the greater Dhaka and Mymensingh area.</p>
<p>Being the largest and oldest gas distribution entity founded in 1964, Titas currently has a network of 13,197 km underground pipeline to distribute gas to the customers.</p>
<p> “But most of its pipeline network is very old and in many areas they are marred with leakage”, said State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid at a recent webinar.</p>

<p>He said some of the pipelines are between 40-50 years old which need to be replaced as they lost their capacity and leakages occur.  </p>
<p>Titas Gas officials said they have been implementing different projects to relocate and rehabilitate gas pipelines based on emergency needs for the sake of facilitating some mega infrastructure projects like metro-rail, elevated expressway and flyovers.</p>
<p> “But the new project will be a massive one which will cover from small scale pipeline to large scale pipeline across the city”, said another Titas official.</p>

</div>";Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company is going to take up a massive project to overhaul its age-old gas pipelines in Dhaka metropolitan city to make the flow more smooth and minimize risks of accidents.Official sources said the plan for changing the ageing pipelines came to be regarded as the core needs amid a series of recent explosions and fire accidents blamed on faulty and leaking lines.When a huge explosion killed at least six people and injured several others in Moghbazar in last June, fire service officials suspected leakage in Titas gas line as the cause.Also read: Leakage in Titas pipeline at a mosque in Fatullah led to the explosions in six air conditioners leaving at least 27 people killed and over a dozen injured during Friday prayers in 2020, in one of country’s worst gas explosions.These tragic incidents apart, the issue of the leakage in pipelines also came to the attention of the authorities when Titas Gas started installing pre-paid meters in parts of the city.Titas GasTitas officials said their teams found huge leakages in pipelines in both customers’ end as well as utility end when they worked for pre-paid gas meters in recent years.Read Admitting the issue, a top official of Titas Gas said that they are now working on the ministry’s instructions to overhaul the pipelines.According to official sources, initially a plan was earlier submitted to the energy and mineral resources division of the ministry of power, energy and mineral resources for approval.But it was reverted to the Titas Gas authority with some observations and suggestions to accommodate those in the plan, said a senior official of energy and mineral resources division.Also read:  “We’ve sent back the relevant file with some observations and suggestions to follow those in their plan to make it more effective”, he told UNB preferring anonymity as he was not authorized to speak on the issue.Titas Gas general manager (planning and development) Shafiqul Islam, who is dealing with the plan, informed that the organisation’s current plan is to conduct a techno-economic feasibility study first and then prepare a design based on its report to implement the proposed pipeline replacement project. “Preparing a geographic information system (GIS) mapping is also part of the plan”, he added.He said the Titas Gas authority is now in a process to appoint a consultant to conduct the study.Read Official sources said as per the plan the Titas Gas will replace the aged-old pipeline in 60 administrative zones, out of total 139 zones across its command area.The proposed area is mainly located in the Dhaka metropolitan city although Titas has a vast network elsewhere including in Narayanganj, Savar, Manikganj, Munshiganj, Mymensing and Norsingdi.  Officials said the pipeline replacement project will be implemented by the Titas’ own funds.However, the financial involvement in the project is yet to be determined as this will depend on the report of the techno-economic feasibility study and on the basis of the next design.Also read: Shafiqul said pipelines too dilapidated for the service and unfit to serve the growing gas supply demand will be changed. “But, those found to be in good condition will be kept”, he said adding that this work will be a kind of BMRE (balancing, modernization, rehabilitation and expansion).He also informed that one of the main objectives of the techno-economic study is tracing out the leakage in the pipeline network. Titas Gas’s huge network has pipelines of different diameters that include from 3/4 to 16 diameters.   Read Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company, having a customer base of 2.874 million, has been responsible for gas supply to the greater Dhaka and Mymensingh area.Being the largest and oldest gas distribution entity founded in 1964, Titas currently has a network of 13,197 km underground pipeline to distribute gas to the customers. “But most of its pipeline network is very old and in many areas they are marred with leakage”, said State Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Nasrul Hamid at a recent webinar.Read He said some of the pipelines are between 40-50 years old which need to be replaced as they lost their capacity and leakages occur.  Titas Gas officials said they have been implementing different projects to relocate and rehabilitate gas pipelines based on emergency needs for the sake of facilitating some mega infrastructure projects like metro-rail, elevated expressway and flyovers. “But the new project will be a massive one which will cover from small scale pipeline to large scale pipeline across the city”, said another Titas official.Read

<div class=""news-article-text-block text-patter-edit ref-link"" id=""ref-link"">
A fire at a grid substation at Ulon in Rampura area led to blackout in vast areas of the city’s southern part.
 
According to official sources at Power Grid Company of Bangladesh (PGCB), the fire broke out at the 132/33 kV grid substation around 4pm, but it was not clear what caused the fire.
 
Soon after the incident, several units of Fire Service and Civil Defence rushed to the spot and brought the fire under control at about 4:50pm, the sources said.
 
A PGCB official informed that electricity supply in the city’s Motijheel, Rampura, Jatrabari, Lalbagh and Dhanmondi areas was severely disrupted following the fire.
 
“We’re trying to restore the electricity supply to the areas through alternative means,” a PGCB official told UNB.
 
He, however, said the substation was recently handed over to Dhaka Power Distribution Company (DPDC). 
 
“But still both the PGCB and DPDC officials were jointly operating the substation,” he said.

Two women were killed and three others were injured after a truck hit an auto-rickshaw on Sherpur-Dhaka Highway at Zamuna Para in Sherpur upazila on Sunday.
 
The deceased were identified as Nila Khatun, 35, wife of Sultan Mahmud of Sherua village in the upazila and Arpita Saha, 20, daughter of Jibon Saha of Mathurapur village in Dhunat upazila.
 
Ratan Islam, station officer of Sherpur Fire Service and Civil Defence, said the accident took place around 10am when the Dhaka-bound truck hit an auto-rickshaw, leaving Nila dead on the spot and four others injured.
 
The injured were taken to Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College Hospital where Arpita died later.
 
Road crashes claim thousands of lives every year and they are mainly blamed on unskilled drivers, unfit vehicles and rundown road condition.
 
Last year, road crashes left 5,227 people dead and 6,953 injured, according to a road safety advocacy group. In February alone, at least 534 people were killed and 1,169 others injured.
 
In a report published in February, the World Bank said Bangladesh needs to invest an estimated extra $7.8 billion over the next decade to halve its road crash fatalities.

<p>There was also lack of proper monitoring and supervision by authorities concerned in this regard, he added.</p>
<p>The SCRF observation also said an increase in the number of small and local mechanised vehicles on regional roads and inter-district roads and highways, extortion in several spots, including all bus and truck terminals, displeasure of transport workers and overall anarchy in the road transport sector were the other reasons behind road accidents.   </p>

<p>The report said the transport management on roads and waterways was comparatively better during this Eid than a few years ago.</p>
<p>Almost all the highways were free from gridlocks while there were enough launches in Dhaka to carry homebound people to coastal areas, it said.</p>
<p>According to the report, Eid holidaymakers were, however, deprived of desired services from the railway authorities for the schedule collapse of trains.</p>
<p>Besides, the authorities concerned failed to check exorbitant bus and launch fares charged from passengers, the NCPSRR said. </p>

<p>However, Bangladesh’s lone representative to the investigation commission Salauddin M Rahmatullah said the report only blamed the pilot without mentioning the faults of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) of Tribhuvan International Airport.</p>
<p>The US-Bangla Airlines flight BS211 from Dhaka crashed on its second landing attempt at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan International Airport on March 12, 2018, killing 51 people, including the pilot and co-pilot, and injuring 20 others.</p>
<p>The investigation report compiled by Nepalese officials and made available Monday said the probable cause of the crash was the pilot's disorientation and loss of situation awareness, reports AP.</p>
<p>The Nepalese investigation report said, ""Contributing to this, the aircraft was offset to the proper approach path that led to maneuvers in a very dangerous and unsafe altitude to alight with the runway. Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude.”</p>
<p>It also said the pilot had been released from the Bangladesh Air Force in 1993 due to depression and was only allowed to fly civilian planes from 2002 after a detailed medical evaluation.</p>
<p>Also, the pilot was under stress and emotionally disturbed and had lack of sleep in the preceding night.</p>
<p>The report also cited a lack of assertiveness from controllers at Kathmandu airport in monitoring the flight path and failing to issue clear instructions to carry out a standard missed-approach procedure.</p>
<p>The flight crew and the controllers also lacked a clear understanding of each other when they communicated about the landing runway, the report said.</p>
<p>The report recommended that assertiveness in such situations become part of the training for air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>It also asked the Bangladesh civil aviation authority to reassess the physical and psychological status of grounded pilots before their licenses are renewed and that all airline pilots undergo psychological evaluation during training.</p>
<p>Salauddin, also Flight Operation Consultant of Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB), briefed reporters over the report in Dhaka on Monday.</p>
<p>He said, “The pilot missed the approach while landing the aircraft. Although the ATC could have assisted the pilot, they didn’t do so. Rather the ATC officials took shelter under the table when the plane crashed near the ATC tower.” </p>
<p>“When the pilot missed the approach, two pilots on ground requested the ATC to assist the pilot through the radar. But the ATC didn’t take any measure in this regard. Had the ATC assisted the pilot, the accident could have been averted,” the CAAB official said.</p>
<p>He said Bangladesh will put forward some proposals for incorporation in the report. “If the proposals are not included, Bangladesh will lodge complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO),” he said.</p>
<p>CAAB Chairman Air Vice Marshal M Naim Hassan said the pilot somehow missed the approach, but it was the duty of the ATC to assist him. “They (ATC officials) didn’t do so.”<br>

<p>Bankrolling Leicester City but without the lavish spending of the bigger clubs, the Thai billionaire oversaw one of the greatest underdog successes in sports when the 5,000-1 outsiders won soccer's richest competition in 2016.</p>
<p>In an era of often-absentee foreign owners in the Premier League, Vichai also broke the mold by forging close ties with supporters and the local community.</p>
<p>While Vichai did not seek the limelight and was far from flamboyant, the wealthy entrepreneur's grandiose mode of transport from the King Power stadium named after his duty-free empire became symbolic of the club's newfound status in the game. A helicopter would land on the field after matches and whisk away the owner.</p>
<p>Saturday night was the last journey for Vichai.</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was seen weeping as he stared at a fireball in a carpark outside the stadium around an hour after a 1-1 draw with West Ham. Moments earlier, the AgustaWestland AW169 had risen from the center circle and cleared the stadium roof before it spiraled out of control and plummeted into an adjacent carpark in flames.</p>
<p>The 60-year-old Vichai and the four other people on board did not survive the inferno, Leicester announced Sunday.</p>
<p>""I am so totally devastated. I just cannot believe what I saw last night,"" Schmeichel said. In an emotional tribute to Vichai, the seven-year veteran of the club said: ""You changed football. Forever. You gave hope to everyone that the impossible was possible, not just to our fans but to fans all over the world in any sport.""</p>
<p>On the spot where fans danced into the night after the improbable title victory two years ago, people gathered through the day to mourn. Hours before the Sunday night confirmation that Vichai did not survive the crash, scarves, jerseys and flowers were laid in an ever-expanding memorial in front of the stadium.</p>
<p>""Without you,"" read one message on a club flag, ""the dream wouldn't have become reality.""</p>
<p>Leicester's next game, which had been scheduled for Tuesday against Southampton in the League Cup, has been postponed.</p>
<p>""We now have a responsibility as a club, as players and fans to honor you,"" Schmeichel said.</p>
<p>Two members of Vichai's staff, Nursara Suknamai and Kaveporn Punpare, also died along with pilot Eric Swaffer and passenger Izabela Roza Lechowicz. Fears that family members were on board were allayed through the day, with his Vichai's son, Aiyawatt, now in line to step up from his role as vice chairman.</p>
<p>""The world has lost a great man,"" the Leicester club said in a statement. ""A man of kindness, of generosity and a man whose life was defined by the love he devoted to his family and those he so successfully led.""</p>
<p>Vichai, who started with one shop and grew Thailand's massive King Power duty-free chain, bought Leicester for 39 million pounds ($50 million) in 2010 when it was in the second-tier competition. Avoiding relegation in its first season back in the Premier League was remarkable enough in 2015 after spending much time in last place. But that was eclipsed in 2016 by the team winning the top-flight title for the first time since being founded in 1884.</p>
<p>""I always believed in the power of our spirit,"" Vichai said at the time. ""It drove us to reach the Premier League, it gave us the strength to stay in the Premier League, and now it has inspired us to win the Premier League.</p>
<p>""It is a spirit that has spread beyond Leicester, taking our story to the hearts of the world. Our spirit exists because of the love we share for each other and the energy it helps to create, both on and off the pitch, and in the years to come, it will continue to be our greatest asset.""</p>
<p>Vichai was ridiculed for hiring the manager who masterminded the title success. Claudio Ranieri had been out of work since being fired by the weak Greece national team and his only job in the Premier League at Chelsea ended 11 years earlier. But it proved to be an inspired recruitment, helping to turn a humdrum group of journeymen and modestly purchased signings into a lineup that overpowered the mega-rich giants of the Premier League.</p>
<p>""That was a dream,"" life-long supporter Ian Hubber said outside the stadium on Sunday. ""This is a nightmare.""</p>
<p>The outpouring of emotion at the stadium on Sunday reflected how highly the ownership is regarded in the city, which has only one professional soccer team. Vichai has formed a close bond with the fans, sometimes mingling with them at games.</p>
<p>Vichai has been praised for his charity work, donating 2 million pounds ($2.5 million) toward a new local children's hospital, and he often provided free beer and food for fans outside games.</p>
<p>""He's an owner who actually cared about a club,"" 19-year-old fan Rikesh Vaja said. ""It's not just the club. He impacted the entire city.""</p>
<p>He also gained for the club new fans in Thailand, where they mourned Vichai's sudden death.</p>
<p>""It's Thailand's team,"" soccer fan Chatworachet Sae-Kow said in Bangkok. ""It brought fame to Thailand when they won (the title). He carried the Thai flag with him and made people know more about Thailand.""</p>

Boise, Sep 2 (AP/UNB) — Randy Brooks' son had a request three years ago: What could his dad do to make wildland firefighting safer?

<p>To Brooks, a professor at the University of Idaho's College of Natural Resources who deals with wildland firefighting, it was more of a command.</p>
<p>His son, Bo Brooks, is a wildland firefighter who a few days earlier during that 2015 fire season fled a wall of flames that killed three of his fellow firefighters in eastern Washington.</p>
<p>The result of the conversation was an online survey that drew some 400 firefighters who mostly identified mental and physical fatigue as the primary cause of injuries to firefighters who are often confronted with a changing, dangerous environment.</p>
<p>But a self-selecting online survey is not necessarily representative of what's happening in the field. So Randy Brooks decided to apply some science.</p>
<p>That led to an ongoing health-monitoring study involving wrist-worn motion monitors and body composition measurements that last year found health declines and deteriorating reaction times among firefighters as the season progressed.</p>
<p>""A lot of them face peer pressure to perform all the time,"" Brooks said. ""Others feel pressured to protect natural resources and structures at all costs.""</p>
<p>About 19,000 firefighters are currently in the field fighting nearly 40 large wildfires. Fourteen firefighters have died this year as wildfires have scorched about 3,500 square miles (9,000 square kilometers) and destroyed about 3,000 homes.</p>
<p>The study last year found firefighters lost muscle mass but gained fat based on body-composition testing before and after the season.</p>
<p>The firefighters also wore a wrist device called a Readiband from a company called Fatigue Science. The device keeps track of how many hours of sleep a person gets. Formulas developed by the U.S. military then calculate fatigue, based on a lack of sleep. That's used to predict alertness and reaction times, which get worse as fatigue levels rise.</p>
<p>Firefighters in the field can get as little as six hours of sleep or less each night. The devices found that not only did reaction times falter as firefighters remained longer on a fire before getting a mandatory break, Brooks said, but firefighters also tended to take longer to recover as the season progressed. Sometimes, fatigue levels reached a level that suggested reaction times slowed down so much it took firefighters twice as long to react.</p>
<p>Brooks said his initial thoughts are that wildland firefighters might need better nutrition to stay fit and mentally sharp. But last year's study had only nine firefighters. Brooks this year has expanded the study to 18 firefighters, 16 men and two women. They're smokejumpers, meaning they parachute from airplanes to fight fires.</p>
<p>Brooks said that next year he hopes to have about 100 firefighters and include hotshot crews, a ground-based wildland firefighter that can, like smokejumpers, be deployed on a national basis.</p>
<p>Smokejumpers in the study often eat pre-made meals. Brooks wants to find out if maybe those meals are behind some of the puzzling results from last year's study, such as a loss in muscle mass.</p>
<p>Hotshots, meanwhile, can return to a central spot where they get prepared food supplied by the U.S. Forest Service. That agency has done extensive research on what it takes to keep wildland firefighters fueled, and contractors who supply the meals must meet Forest Service nutritional guidelines.</p>
<p>Forest Service health experts have even followed firefighting crews to take blood samples to check glucose levels, which can indicate alertness.</p>
<p>Joe Domitrovich, an exercise physiologist with the Forest Service's National Technology and Development Program in Missoula, Montana, said that experiment led the agency to change gears and recommend firefighters snack during their shifts to keep glucose levels up.</p>
<p>""It's critical for cognitive function as well as physical movement,"" he said.</p>
<p>The agency declined to comment on the University of Idaho study.</p>
<p>Brooks said at this point in his study there are more questions than answers. For example, one question is why so many firefighter deaths are due to falling branches or trees. The deaths of three of the 14 firefighters who died last year were due to what are called hazard trees. At least one firefighter was killed by a falling tree this year, and several more have been injured.</p>
<p>""What I'm trying to figure out is what is causing these accidents,"" Brooks said.</p>
<p>A fair number of wildland firefighters also die of heart attacks during the season. Brooks said he wants to know if there's something about the demanding seasonal job that puts wildland firefighters at greater risk of heart attacks.</p>
<p>Brooks wonders about the smoke firefighters inhale while doing physically demanding work. Many cities in the Pacific Northwest this year issued health alerts due to smoky air.</p>
<p>Ultimately, firefighters themselves might be part of the problem when it comes to calculating risks while protecting natural resources and property.</p>
<p>""There's a little bit of a hero culture,"" said John Freemuth, a Boise State University environmental policy professor and public lands expert. ""There is a bonding with everybody. It can create a culture of where you kind of collectively ignore things you shouldn't ignore.""</p>

Brooks wants to find out if maybe those meals are behind some of the puzzling results from last year's study, such as a loss in muscle mass.Hotshots, meanwhile, can return to a central spot where they get prepared food supplied by the U.S. Forest Service. That agency has done extensive research on what it takes to keep wildland firefighters fueled, and contractors who supply the meals must meet Forest Service nutritional guidelines.Forest Service health experts have even followed firefighting crews to take blood samples to check glucose levels, which can indicate alertness.Joe Domitrovich, an exercise physiologist with the Forest Service's National Technology and Development Program in Missoula, Montana, said that experiment led the agency to change gears and recommend firefighters snack during their shifts to keep glucose levels up.""It's critical for cognitive function as well as physical movement,"" he said.The agency declined to comment on the University of Idaho study.Brooks said at this point in his study there are more questions than answers. For example, one question is why so many firefighter deaths are due to falling branches or trees. The deaths of three of the 14 firefighters who died last year were due to what are called hazard trees. At least one firefighter was killed by a falling tree this year, and several more have been injured.""What I'm trying to figure out is what is causing these accidents,"" Brooks said.A fair number of wildland firefighters also die of heart attacks during the season. Brooks said he wants to know if there's something about the demanding seasonal job that puts wildland firefighters at greater risk of heart attacks.Brooks wonders about the smoke firefighters inhale while doing physically demanding work. Many cities in the Pacific Northwest this year issued health alerts due to smoky air.Ultimately, firefighters themselves might be part of the problem when it comes to calculating risks while protecting natural resources and property.""There's a little bit of a hero culture,"" said John Freemuth, a Boise State University environmental policy professor and public lands expert. ""There is a bonding with everybody. It can create a culture of where you kind of collectively ignore things you shouldn't ignore."""

<p>They said almost all the existing 8,000 public buses in the city are completely unfit for running in a capital city like Dhaka and those should be replaced with high quality and standard and comfortable ones working out a comprehensive phase-out plan like the one that replaced thousands of two-stroke auto-rickshaws with CNG-run ones in 2003.</p>
<p>Noted urban expert and former chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Prof Nazrul Islam, Buet’s Accident Research Institute (ARI) director Prof Moazzem Hossain, Buet’s Urban and Regional Planning department Prof Dr Sarwar Jahan and urban expert and architect Iqbal Habib came up with the observations while talking to UNB.</p>
<p>Prof Nazrul Islam said the buses in the capital must have acceptable standards. “The existing bus services in Dhaka are far below the minimum standard. We must ensure quality and comfortable and passenger-friendly bus services to reduce people’s dependence on private vehicles.”</p>
<p>As Dhaka is a densely populated city, the urban expert thinks, double-decker buses are very effective here to solve transport crisis and ensure the optimum use of the existing roads.</p>
<p>Besides, Nazrul said, the government must bring the buses under five-six franchises by rationalising the existing routes as soon as possible. “The bus management system will improve once the vehicles come under limited franchises.”</p>
<p>Citing a government survey, Iqbal Habib said, around 6,900 buses were there in Dhaka city in 2017. “Most of these buses are not suitable to run in the city. Only around 2,600 buses can be overhauled and upgraded while the rest are totally unfit for the capital city. It’s government survey finding, not my opinion.”</p>
<p>He said late Mayor of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Annisul Huq had taken a step to procure 3,000 modern and standard buses for Dhaka as part of a plan to phase out the unfit ones. “After his death, the process has got stuck.”<br>
 <br>
Habib, also a joint secretary of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon, said the government should give the bus owners tax-free facilities and soft loan to procure high-quality buses to replace the current ones. “It’s possible as we’ve a successful example of removing auto-rickshaws from the capital city in 2003. So, we’ll be able to replace the sub-standard buses with high-quality ones if a proper step is taken.”</br></br></p>
<p>He said city buses should be suitable for the use of children, elderly, physically-challenged people and women. “The current bus fleets are not friendly ones to all passengers.”</p>
<p>Besides, Habib said, the government should take steps for the better use of rail and waterways to make Dhaka a safe and moveable city and reduce pressure on roads.</p>
<p>Moazzem Hossain said it is not only the fact that most buses in Dhaka are unfit but also the drivers are ineligible for plying vehicles here.</p>
<p>“Every resident of the capital city deserves far better bus services in Dhaka than the existing ones. It’s peculiar that over 200 bus companies are in an unholy competition of doing business in a megacity like Dhaka. Why air-conditioned buses are not available for passengers here? Why does a human-hauler like Leguna still runs in the capital?” he questioned. </p>
<p>Hossain, also a professor of Buet’s civil engineering department, thinks high quality buses, skilled and disciplined drivers, better city transport management, and introduction of “bus route franchising system and modernisation of bus terminals” are necessary to improve the standard of bus services in Dhaka.</p>
<p>To remove unholy competition by buses for passengers, he said, it is necessary to design a well-networked bus routes extending to all possible areas (with franchising) and improve the frequency of buses and ticketing system. </p>
<p>Dr Sarwar Jahan said the existing buses in Dhaka cannot be allowed to operate in the capital of a country which is becoming middle-income one. </p>
<p>He said the government should make effective plans with suggestions from experts in the relevant field for replacing the existing bus fleets with modern and standard ones after introducing a franchising system. </p>
<p>“Considering people’s economic condition, there can be different categories of buses. But, all the buses should have minimum standard to ply the streets of a capital city…the transport system in Dhaka suffers for lack of vision, not for money,” Sarwar said.</p>
<p>The urban expert thinks dedicated lanes for exclusive bus travel by implementing the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is very urgent for improving the bus service.</p>
<p>As Dhaka lacks sufficient roads, the policymakers should encourage mass transports instead of private vehicles on the streets. “We need to control the use of private vehicles and expand public transport fleet buses and double-decker ones. It’s been proved as a very effective measure in many cities like London and Moscow.” <br>

<p>The pilot of the US-Bangla plane that crashed at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport in March killing 51 people, appears to have ‘lied’ to the control tower during the landing procedure and was smoking continuously inside the cockpit during the one-hour flight from Dhaka to Kathmandu, said the report, a copy of which was obtained by the Kathmandu Post.</p>
<p>Throughout the flight, Sultan was engaged in ‘erratic behaviour’ that marked a departure from his usual character-signs that should have immediately raised red flags, Nepali investigators concluded in the report.</p>
<p>Six minutes before the landing time, Sultan had confirmed that the plane’s landing gear was down and locked. “Gears down, three greens,” the pilot said, according to the report, referring to the electrical indicator lights inside the cockpit.</p>
<p>However, when co-pilot Prithula Rashid conducted a final landing checklist, the landing gears were not down. Minutes later, the plane carrying 67 passengers and four crew members burst into flames after missing the runway during its second landing attempt.</p>
<p>The majority of the 22 Nepalis killed in the crash were medical students who had come home on a two-month leave before their final year results were published. Only 20 passengers survived the crash.</p>
<p>Investigators say Sultan had been ‘smoking cigarettes frequently’ during the hour-long flight from Dhaka to Kathmandu.</p>
<p>The former Bangladeshi Air Force pilot, who had clocked more than 5,500 flying hours, had not disclosed to the airlines that he was a smoker, leading investigators to conclude that Sultan was undergoing severe mental stress inside the cockpit.</p>
<p>“When we analysed the conversation on the Cockpit Voice Recorder, it was clear to us that the captain was harbouring severe mental stress. He also seemed to be fatigued and tired due to lack of sleep,” investigators wrote in the report. “He was crying on several occasions.”</p>
<p>The voice recorder has captured nearly an hour-long conversation between the captain and his co-pilot in the cockpit, further demonstrating Sultan’s ‘tensed mood’ throughout the flight and a ‘complete lack of situational awareness’, according to the report.</p>
<p>It was not clear whom the pilot was directing the statement at, as the co-pilot was the only crew member present inside the cockpit during the flight.</p>
<p>The report also shows that Sultan made multiple abusive statements toward a female colleague [another co-pilot in the company] who had questioned his reputation as an instructor, and their relationship was a major topic of discussion throughout the flight. Records show that Rashid, the co-pilot, was a passive listener to Sultan’s story throughout the flight.</p>
<p>“A cockpit is a place where personal conversations between colleagues are strictly prohibited when the aircraft is preparing to land or take off,” said Captain Shrawan Rijal of Nepal Airlines. “It’s a strictly enforced cockpit rule, which instructs pilots to focus entirely on the aircraft’s operations.”</p>
<p>At one point during the flight, according to details from the audio recorder, the pilot broke down and said that he was “very upset and hurt by the behaviour of the female colleague” and that “she was the only reason he was leaving the company.”</p>
<p>The captain had expressed his desire to resign a day before the accident, the report says, although he had not submitted any written documents. He said that he wished to continue on the job for three more months to complete training the co-pilots.</p>
<p>Sultan had joined US-Bangla in 2015. Prior to flying commercial flights, he had served in the Bangladesh Air Force, and according to reports, had a history of depression. While in the Bangladesh Air Force, back in 1993, he had been removed from active duty after a psychiatric assessment. But he was re-evaluated by a psychiatrist back on January 9, 2002, and had been declared fit for flying.</p>
<p>The report said that Sultan’s detail medical history was not reviewed by US-Bangla Airlines when he was hired.</p>
<p>Kamrul Islam, general manager and spokesperson for the US-Bangla Airlines, declined the Post’s request for comment.</p>
<p>However, the report clarifies that Sultan did not exhibit any recurring mental issues during the medical examinations from 2002 to 2018.</p>
<p>“None of the medical reports that the committee reviewed from 2012 to 2017 mentioned any symptoms about depression,” the report said, adding that during his routine medical evaluations, he was declared fit and free from any symptoms of depression.</p>
<p>Aviation officials are expected to make a summary of the report public at the end of August.</p>
<p>According to the report, Sultan then lit a cigarette, when the aircraft had just under three minutes to start their initial approach. This, the report says, demonstrated complacency and gross negligence of procedural discipline on the pilot’s part.<br>
