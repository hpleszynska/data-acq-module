<20240330>;<20240330>;<Dhaka>;<Wheels of hazard: Motorcycle safety crisis unfolding on Bangladesh’s roads>;"<<div class=""text"">
<div class=""news-article-text-block text-patter-edit ref-link"">
<p>In Bangladesh, motorcycles, with their ease of navigation and cost-effectiveness, have become a popular mode of transport. However, this preference comes with a significant drawback: motorcycles are at the epicenter of the nation’s road safety crisis. While there was a hopeful decrease in motorcycle-related accidents in the past year compared to 2022, these two-wheelers remain the most common protagonist in the tragic tales of road accidents across the country. The situation is dire, with not only deaths being a common outcome but an increasing number of individuals suffering life-altering injuries, including the loss of limbs.</p>
<p>The National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways (NCPSRR), a vigilant civic organization, illuminates this pressing issue with alarming statistics: from 2020 to 2023, 33-40% of all annual road accidents involved motorcycles. This figure has been on a distressing upward trajectory since the start of this year. According to the NCPSRR, the daily average ranges from 8 to 10 fatalities in 10 to 12 motorcycle accidents—a grim statistic that often escapes the attention of the national media spotlight.</p>
<p>The heart of this crisis is attributed to the presence of underage, unskilled, and unlicensed drivers on the roads. The lack of stringent enforcement by the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) and the police has been pinpointed as a contributing factor. Ashis Kumar Dey, the general secretary of NCPSRR, doesn’t mince words when he lists the reasons behind the spike in motorcycle accidents: the proliferation of motorcycles, including many that are unlicensed, and reckless driving habits are significant contributors. Dey strongly believes that both law enforcement and the regulatory body, BRTA, need to intensify their efforts.</p>

<p>To combat this escalating problem, Dey proposes a comprehensive crackdown on underage and unlicensed riders and unregistered motorcycles. He advocates for the implementation of mobile courts across all districts for three consecutive months, a bold strategy aimed at curtailing the rampant violations contributing to road safety hazards.</p>
<p>The Road Safety Foundation (RSF) adds a quantitative dimension to the discourse with its annual report, revealing that in 2023, 6,524 individuals, including 974 women and 1,128 children, lost their lives in 6,911 road accidents across the country. Motorbike riders and pillion passengers comprised a staggering 38.12% of these fatalities.</p>
<p>Delving deeper into the data, RSF provides a comparative analysis of motorcycle accidents and fatalities over recent years, presenting a grim narrative of increasing incidents and loss of lives, peaking in 2022. However, a glimmer of hope emerges from the 2023 statistics, showing a 14.83% decrease in accidents and a 19.54% drop in fatalities compared to the previous year. Despite this positive trend, Saidur Rahman, executive director of RSF, remains cautious, warning that this decrease should not be prematurely celebrated as a sign of sustained improvement in road safety.</p>
<p>Rahman further elaborates on the challenges at hand, pointing out that motorcycles constitute 71% of all motor vehicles in the country, with a significant portion of these riders being teenagers and young adults. This demographic exhibits a pronounced disregard for traffic laws, exacerbated by a lack of stringent monitoring and enforcement, leading to reckless behavior and tragic outcomes. <br>The discourse takes a critical turn as Rahman highlights the frequent clashes between motorcycles and larger vehicles such as trucks, covered vans, and buses. The drivers of these larger vehicles often lack the necessary skill or are overworked, contributing to their involvement in accidents with motorcycles. The inadequacy of the public transport system and the chronic issue of traffic congestion have further popularized motorcycles as a preferred mode of transport, despite the associated risks.</br></p>

<p>In a noteworthy development, Rahman acknowledges the role of increased awareness and the efforts of highway police in the recent decline in motorcycle accidents. Abu Raihan Md Saleh, Joint Commissioner (Traffic-North) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, supports this view, attributing the reduction in accidents to the rigorous enforcement of traffic laws. Saleh’s remarks underline the police’s commitment to curbing reckless riding, unregistered bikes, and license violations, although this has led to complaints from bikers about perceived overzealous policing.</p>
<p>Saleh also emphasizes the crucial role of parental responsibility in preventing underage and inexperienced individuals from taking to the roads on motorcycles. He expresses optimism that with heightened vigilance from parents and guardians, the trend of motorcycle accidents can be further curbed.</p>
<p>This multifaceted crisis of motorcycle safety in Bangladesh calls for a concerted effort from all stakeholders: law enforcement, regulatory bodies, civic organizations, and the community at large. The statistics and stories paint a clear picture of the challenge ahead, yet they also offer a blueprint for action. By addressing the root causes of motorcycle accidents and implementing targeted safety measures, Bangladesh can hope to navigate its way out of this perilous situation, making its roads safer for everyone.</p>

<div class=""news-article-text-block text-patter-edit ref-link"">
<p>In a distressing incident last night, reckless driving led to a multi-vehicle crash inside the Bangabandhu Tunnel in Chattogram, resulting in damage to at least five vehicles and injuring several people. The accident, occurring in one of the tunnel's lanes, underscores the growing concerns over traffic safety.</p>
<p>Assistant Sub-Inspector Billal Hossain of the Karnaphuli Police Station, under the Chattogram Metropolitan Police, reported that the chain-reaction collision was initiated by a private car that lost control due to excessive speed. The vehicle's erratic maneuvering led to it colliding with nearby cars, impacting a total of three private cars and two microbuses.</p>

<p>Following the accident, one of the injured was rushed to Chattogram Medical College Hospital for immediate medical attention, while others sought treatment at various hospitals. The precise number of individuals injured in the ordeal remains uncertain.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the collision, authorities seized all vehicles involved as part of their ongoing investigation into the incident. This accident adds to a troubling pattern of similar occurrences within the Bangabandhu Tunnel, which has seen seven to eight accidents in the mere four months following its inauguration on October 28 last year.</p>
<p>The situation has been further complicated by a video that surfaced online, showcasing illegal car racing inside the tunnel immediately after its opening. The viral footage prompted legal action, with a case filed on November 1 against the individuals involved, highlighting the urgent need for enhanced safety measures and stricter enforcement of traffic regulations within this crucial infrastructure.</p>

</div>>";<Although a year has passed since the Barguna launch fire tragedy, families still mourn their missing loved ones. A devastating fire broke out at Barguna-bound launch ‘MV-Avijan-10’ on December 24 last year. The launch, with 800 passengers on board, was heading towards Barguna and the fire broke out on Sugandha river in Jhalakathi. Forty-nine people died in the tragedy while the exact numbers of passengers traveling on the launch and the missing passengers are yet to be known. One hundred people were injured in the incident.  Many did not get any compensation for what they lost during the fire. Besides, families of missing passengers say no financial assistance has been provided to them. After the fire, the local administration of Barguna district handed over 25 bodies to their relatives while 23 people were buried in a mass graveyard in the district. Khalil, along with his wife and three children, was heading towards Barguna by the launch. Khalil and his wife managed to survive but they still mourn their three missing children. Meanwhile, Golam Mahbub’s offspring and elderly mother are inconsolable after losing him and his brother during the launch fire. Criminal Investigation Department (CID) collected samples of 51 people for identifying the 23 unclaimed bodies that were buried in Potkakhali mass graveyard in the Sadar upazila of Barguna district. Sixteen eople have been identified through DNA test. A case with Barguna Chief Judicial Magistrate Court against the owner of MV Avijan-10, Hamjalal Sheikh, and 24 others in connection with the deadly fire on the launch has been lodged, said Shahidul Islam Milon, inspector (Investigation) of Barguna police station.>
